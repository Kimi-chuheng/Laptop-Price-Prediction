# Laptop Price Prediction&Apartment Price Clustering

## Project Overview
This project consists of two main parts: **Regression** and **Clustering**, conducted as the final project for **UMKC COMP-SCI-5530 (Fall 2024)**. The datasets were provided by the professor, with their original online sources unknown.

## Project Structure
- `data/` - Contains the datasets:
  - `laptop_prices.csv` - Used for regression analysis.
  - `apartments_for_rent.csv` - Used for clustering analysis.
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter Notebooks for analysis.
- `src/` - Python scripts for data preprocessing and modeling.
- `docs/` - Documentation and reports.

## Regression Analysis (Laptop Prices)
- **Objective**: Predict laptop prices using various machine learning models.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
  - Random Forest
  - CatBoost
  - Other machine learning regression models
- **Dataset**: `laptop_prices.csv` (features related to laptop specifications)

## Clustering Analysis (Apartment Rentals)
- **Objective**: Analyze rental price patterns using clustering techniques.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Other clustering methods
- **Dataset**: `apartments_for_rent.csv` (features related to apartment characteristics)

## Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, CatBoost, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Data Source Disclaimer
The datasets were provided by the professor. Their original source is likely from the internet but remains unspecified.
